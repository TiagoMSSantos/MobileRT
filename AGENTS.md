# Project AGENTS.md Guide

This AGENTS.md file provides comprehensive guidance for AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project Structure for AI agents Navigation

- `/app/MobileRT`: C++ native code of MobileRT
- `/app/Components`: C++ native code of components for MobileRT
- `/app/Scenes`: C++ native code of some test scenes for MobileRT
- `/app/System_dependent`: C++ native code to integrate MobileRT with Qt and Android JNI
- `/app/third_party`: C++ native code of third party submodules that are used by MobileRT
- `/app/Unit_Testing`: C++ native code of unit tests of MobileRT
- `/app/web-server`: Simple web server code in Rust for MobileRT
- `/app/src`: Source Android code that uses MobileRT
  - `/main`: The production code
  - `/androidTest`: Android instrumentation tests
  - `/test`: Android unit tests
- `/.github`: Github Actions
- `/.github/workflows`: Github Actions workflows
- `/.github/codeql`: CodeQL configurations
- `/deploy`: Take the compiled code and package it inside a Docker image, in its distributable format, such as an executable with MobileRT native library

## Coding Conventions for AI agents

### General Conventions

- Ensure all files have an empty line at the end of the file

### C++ Conventions

- Avoid using `auto` keyword and always set the type explicitly

### Java Conventions

- Always use `final` keyword whenever possible except on interfaces and on try-with-resources

### Kotlin Conventions

- Always use builder pattern with private constructors

### Rust Conventions

- Avoid using `unsafe` keyword

## Pull Request Guidelines for AI agents

When AI agent help create a pull request, please ensure it:

1. Includes a clear description of the changes as guided by AGENTS.md
2. References any related issues that AI agent is addressing
3. Ensures all tests pass for code generated by AI agent
4. Includes screenshots for UI changes implemented with AI agent
5. Keeps pull requests focused on a single concern as specified in AGENTS.md
6. Commit messages should follow the pattern:
  - Title format: <type>(<scope>): <title>
    - Possible types: ci/build/chore/fix/feat/refactor/docs/style/perf/test
    - Scopes should be the module updated, or the file name if it makes sense
    - Titles should always start with an upper case and do not finish with terminal punctuation marks
  - Always add a description text after the title with 1 empty line in between
  - After the description, always add a section for the test plan
7. Never approve or merge the opened pull requests, even if all the tests passed

## Testing Requirements for AI agents

AI agents should make sure the Github Actions workflows were executed and all tests passed:

- Android
  - If C++ native or Android code was modified
- Native
  - If C++ native code was modified
- Code Analysis
  - If C++ native or Android code was modified
- Docker
  - If C++ native code was modified

All checks must pass and never approve or merge the opened pull requests, even if all the tests passed. AGENTS.md helps ensure AI agent follows these requirements.
